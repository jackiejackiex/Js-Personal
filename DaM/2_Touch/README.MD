For the Touch project I found a public dataset from https://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/archives. It records the daily ice extend of the northern hemisphere by dates and months.

I first cleaned up the data by collecting the monthly average ice extent using pandas. Then I pulled the 12 month's average number of every five years to create the graphic. The circle represents the largest extent of the ice cap ever recorded. The white lines are guides that represents the 12 month clockwise. The red edges represent the ice cap shrunkage every five years. The more saturated the red, the closer the time was to now. Idealy the visual should be created with frosted glass, with each layer of glass cut out to shape and the thickness represents the extent of August in year 2020, 2015, 2010, 2005, and 2000, so it can emphasize the increasing shrunkage of the ice cap and the progression of climate change from both the top and side profile.
