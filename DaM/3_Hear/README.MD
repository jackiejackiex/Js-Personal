For the Hear project I want to explore the trend of CO2 emissions throughout the years using the p5 oscillator. The sound frequency is mapped to the CO2 emission per capita by years for each country. To adjust the frequency to be in a comfortable hearing range and discernible, the emission number was raised to the power of 2.25. To emphasize the effect, the duration of the sound is also mapped to the number of the emission. So the bigger the emission, the higher-pitched and long-lasting the sound is.
